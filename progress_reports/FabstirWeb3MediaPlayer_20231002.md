Please summarize your progress in 3-5 sentences or bullet points:</h4>

_This month saw major enhancements to the Fabstir Media Player dapp. A key new feature is support for nestable NFTs, enabling hierarchical packaging of related content like trailers with their films or a game asset composed of smaller assets. Users can now mint NFTs directly within the dapp, defining attributes like name, symbol, description and upload of its media content for transcode and storage on to SIA. Biconomy's account abstraction implementation allows gas fee payment with any ERC20 token, not just native blockchain tokens. Onboarding is considerably easier via Particle Network's social login with platforms like gmail, Git, Facebook, X and Discord. Users can easily purchase tokens within the dapp through Transak's integration supporting 100+ fiat currencies. Integration with RMRK enables minting of nestable NFTs to the new NFT2.0 standard. Existing NFTs from marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible can now be upgraded and repackaged with extensive length video NFTs. Overall, major progress was made in managing, creating and accessing NFTs, improving onboarding and payments, and expanding NFT capabilities and user experience._
