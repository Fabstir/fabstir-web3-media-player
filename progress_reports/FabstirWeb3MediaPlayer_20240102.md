<h4>What will you be working on this month?<br>
Please summarize your development goals into a few sentences or bullet points:</h4>

- _The grant period is over and the open-source code is a working tokeniser and consumer of any type of digital asset; data, images, video, music, files, e-books, 3d models and worlds stored on Sia. With additional features that enable construction of NFTs from other NFTs._
- _Plans to continually update, .e.g. add raytracing and FSR upscaling to the Fabstir Renderer and maintain a live deployment for the public to use that can pay for itself._
